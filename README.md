# Star Wars Planet Browser

A flask app to practise using REST APIs.

I started by creating a BasicApi class to be as reusable as possible. I added caching and a separate config.ini file (probably overkill but I wanted to learn how to use configparser).

What I learned:
* Using requests to get data from an API
* Caching the response
* Using a config.ini file with configparser
* Creating tests and fixtures with pytest
